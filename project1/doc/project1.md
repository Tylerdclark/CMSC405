# CMSC 405 - Project 1 - Java 2D Graphics

**Author:** Tyler D Clark  
**Date:** 23 January 2021

**Description** A program that simulates traffic using swing GUI, event handlers, listeners and incorporates Javaâ€™s concurrency functionality and the use of threads. The program first prompts for the number of column and row roads and initial cars. It then creates a canvas and allows the the traffic simulation to be started, paused, stopped and additional cars to be added.

## Running this program

This program was compiled into a jar file for ease of use. The only requirement for this program is an up-to-date Java runtime to be installed on the machine. To run this program, simply enter the command while in the out directory:

``` bash
java -jar project3.jar
```

## Testing the Program

The following sections will test the program's functionality to start various simulations, pause and stop them.

### Test case 1

The first test case will simply test the programs ability to start a traffic simulation with 2 row roads and 2 column roads and 2 cars. These are the default options of the initial panel.

### Test case 2

This test will test the ability of the program to start. After pressing "Start, the timer will begin counting and every second the cars will move (unless they are at a red light). The cars will move a random amount that is set in their constructor.

### Test case 3

The pause is a boolean inside the timer object that is passed to all Threads. This test case shows that when the "pause" is set to true by the JButton, all worker pause.

### Test case 4

The Stop button replaces the JPanel that is being drawn to with a new one with matching starting conditions of the previous one. The cars are still randomly placed. This test case will test that Stop does create a new canvas and it will also test add new random cars using the "Add a car" JButton.

After pressing "Stop", new canvas:

Adding a few cars:

### Test case 5

This test case will test the max options in the initial panel. This simulation is to have 10 rows, 10 columns and 10 initial cars
